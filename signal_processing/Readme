// # Implementation of Digital Filter and Frequency Response Analysis

/*
This project aims to design and implement a digital filter 
that reproduces the frequency response specified in a provided file, 
using the Discrete Fourier Transform. Three impulse responses 
will be generated with M equal to 30, 70, and 150 points, 
accompanied by their respective frequency responses.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the filter, a 150-point filter 
will be applied to three sinusoidal signals of different frequencies, 
allowing for a detailed analysis of the filter's performance 
under varying input conditions.
